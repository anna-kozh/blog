<p class="singlePage_bottom">Iâ€™m Anna, a Senior Product Designer, and I believe I'm a great match for Remote. Let me tell you why:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="780" height="438.75" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aik_6jVxsUY?si=Ip1yDUTZ7JLo4GGp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Remote.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by the opportunity and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>I believe I bring a lot of relevant experience to Remote: my current job in fintech, three years working in Payroll, and three years of remote work experience.</p>

<p>I'm particularly excited about Remote's design principle of "Insights over intuition". It truly aligns with my values and the kind of designer I aspire to be.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
