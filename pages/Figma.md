<p class="singlePage_bottom">Iâ€™m Anna, a Senior Product Designer, and I believe I'm a great match for the role of Product Designer for Developer Tools. Let me tell you why:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="780" height="438.75" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5Y_PfaLHYc?si=hOv5kOTuG1sFcvT4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>Having spent my entire life around developers, building a dev tool sounds like the next logical step. 
What particularly excites me is the opportunity to contribute to Figma community. Beyond UX, I find the biggest life satisfaction in being creative and building communities. By the way, I strongly believe every company should do a Maker Week.</p>
<p>Have a fantastic Config 2024! I look forward to joining you there next year.</p>
