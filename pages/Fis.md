<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by the opportunity and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>I believe I'm perfect for this role for multiple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have experience in fintech, therefore I understand the mindset of the user and stakeholders. </li>
<li>I spent the last 2 years creating and improving Simpology's Design System. I just recently rebuilt it using the latest Figma updates.</li>
<li>I have a development background and I'm dev's "favorite designer". </li>
<li>I work very well in a start-up environment, as I'm obsessed with seeing my product E2E. I also naturally fill in gaps in capabilities. </li>
<li>I'm fun to work with. </li>
</ol>
