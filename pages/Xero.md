<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Xero.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>I personally worked in payroll and bookkeeping at the beginning of my career, so I have a good understanding of the use cases and user struggles. </p>
<p>I also have 4 years of experience using Xero, which has given me a strong understanding and appreciation of the product.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
