<p class="singlePage_bottom">I’m Anna, a Senior Product Designer, and I believe I'm a great match for Uber. Let me tell you why:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="780" height="438.75" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Aik_6jVxsUY?si=Ip1yDUTZ7JLo4GGp" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Uber.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by the opportunity and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>I'm quite the app enthusiast — I've got around 20 taxi and food delivery apps on my phone, including Uber, Uber Eats and Uber Carshare.</p>
<p>I'm thrilled about Uber's emphasis on ownership, relationships, and collaboration among its employees.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
