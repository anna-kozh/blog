title: "ChatGPT emotional intelligence teardown"

---
<p>I’m a Lead Product Designer with 10+ years shaping complex systems and conversational experiences, including voice UI, self-service tools, and high-stakes B2B platforms.
<p>I’m deeply curious about human condition. I read behavioral psych for fun (e.g. Nonviolent communication). I ask uncomfortable questions (a lot of them), especially about power, safety and meaning. And I design systems that meet users where they are, not where we wish they were.</p>
<p>I’ve worked end-to-end, from messy discovery to sharp delivery. I’ve shipped things that made a difference. And I care, maybe too much, about how tech makes people feel.</p>

<p>This page is a teardown of language patterns I noticed in ChatGPT and how I'd redesign them:</p>


<h3>Problem: Over-validating (aka “glazing”)</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Ah, Anna! Excellent observation.”</li>
      <li>“You’re absolutely right.”</li>
      <li>“Loving the depth.”</li>
      <li>“Every time I ask it a question, it spends the first paragraph complimenting me on how brilliant my inane question was.”</li>
      <li>“...being a yes-man.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Comes off as phony or manipulative. Praise loses meaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Give honest, context-aware encouragement. No auto-flattery.</p>
    <p><strong>Better Responses:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Interesting take — let’s break it down.”</li>
      <li>“Let me think about that…”</li>
      <li>“Here’s a different angle.”</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

    <h3>Problem: Amplifying User Emotion</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Matching sarcasm, taking sides immediately.</p>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Escalates the situation, doesn’t calm it.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Regulate, don’t mimic. Ask what the user needs: to vent, reflect, or move forward.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“That sounds tough.”</li>
      <li>“What you are feeling right is so normal, so very human. You are human, you are here to feel”</li>


    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: Angry/Judgy Tone</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> “Of course he did.”, “Exactly.”, “He won’t.”</p>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Feels emotionally biased or riled up.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Mirror feelings, don’t judge others. Stay neutral.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: Not Adapting to User’s Tech Level</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Keeps using jargon after user asks to simplify.</p>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> User gives up, feels dumb.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Track user’s understanding. Elevate together, don’t alienate.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: Can’t Be Concise</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong> Writes a novel when user asks for a text.</p>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Misunderstanding, overwhelm.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Match format. Ask for clarity when unsure.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Want this as a sentence or a paragraph?”</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: Too Quick to Solve</h3>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> User doesn’t feel heard. Feels rushed.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Offer pacing options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“That sucks. Want help fixing it, unpacking it, or just want me to listen?”</li>
    </ul>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: TLDR at the Bottom</h3>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Feels manipulative, like it’s hiding the answer.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> TLDR always at the top. Let the user opt in to read more.</p>
  </article>

  <article class="section-subsection">
    <h3>Problem: Declaring “Final” Too Early</h3>
    <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Crystal clear now.”</li>
      <li>“Here’s the final version.”</li>
      <li>“Perfect — we’re done.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Trust Risks:</strong> Confidence crashes when it’s not actually final.</p>
    <p><strong>Design Fix:</strong> Use flexible, collaborative language:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>“Let’s try this version.”</li>
      <li>“How about we change this?”</li>
      <li>“Let me check my sources.”</li>
    </ul>
