<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/...." target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>Having spent my entire life around developers, building a dev tool sounds like the next logical step. </p>
<p>What particularly excites me is the opportunity to contribute to Figma community. Beyond UX, I find the biggest life satisfaction in being creative and building communities. By the way, I strongly believe every company should do a Maker Week.</p>
