<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Amazon.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>I've used seller services before and been active in several FBA seller groups, which has helped me better understand their goals and mindset.</p>

<p>I'm particularly excited about Amazon's focus on data-driven decisions and taking ownership of the product. In my work, I go beyond UX — I take full responsibility for my product and my team.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
