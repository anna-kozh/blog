<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Snap.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there. </p>
<p>As someone who actively uses Snapchat, I have developed a clear understanding of the user mindset and needs.</p>

I'm thrilled about Snap's dedication to creativity, fostering innovation, and embracing a growth mindset. This is something I aspire to live by every day.</p>
