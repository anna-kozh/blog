<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Meta.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there. </p>
<p>Over the past two years at Simpology, I have created a design system for an ecosystem of products, each capable of being individually branded. I collaborated closely with developers to ensure the design system served both developers and designers.</p>
<p>I'm excited to take my knowledge to the next level with Meta.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
