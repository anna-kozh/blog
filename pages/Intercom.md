<p class="singlePage_bottom">Iâ€™m Anna, a Senior Product Designer, and I believe I'm a great match for Intercom. Let me tell you why:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="780" height="438.75" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bw0EpxbSEnE?si=e0qjqnfotnNLpt_-" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe> </div>

<p class="singlePage">Here are my <a href="../assets/uploads/Resume/Resume_Anna_Kozhevnikova_Intercom.pdf" target="_blank">Resume</a> and <a href="../../index.html" target="_blank">Portfolio</a>.</p>
<p class="cover_letter">On a more serious note, I am genuinely intrigued by this role and eager to learn about the team, its near-future objectives, and how I might fit in there.</p>
<p>Having previously used Intercom, I truly believe in its impact. During my time at SkoolBag, I specifically requested a seat so I could engage with customers, learning about them and their mindset. Additionally, Intercom conversations significantly influenced our roadmap for fixes and desired features. </p>
<p>Just like Intercom, I believe in honesty, transparency, taking ownership of my product, advocating for simple solutions, and prioritizing reuse over creating anew.</p>
<p>What particularly excites me is the opportunity to contribute to Intercom Blog. Beyond UX, I find the biggest life satisfaction in being creative and building communities.</p>

<div class="callout heart">Looking forward to hearing from you!</div>
