description: "Trust is the foundation of every relationship. And whether we realise it or not, we are already in a serious one with technology. It is evolving faster than we are and our trust is still catching up, trying to define what it should look like. This project is my exploration of trust in agentic flows."

<section class="section section--first "><!-- Beginning of CONTEXT -->
<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="context"><span class="step-label" aria-hidden="true">CONTEXT</span>PPC complexity</h2>

<p>Sellers rely on ads to grow their businesses, but many struggle with advertising. Some don’t even know the difference between ACoS and TACoS, let alone how to optimise a campaign. </p>
<p>Third-party tools promise to simplify this, and many now include GenAI features. Sellers are willing to try almost anything if it might help, even paying $100+ per month, yet most tools still deliver mediocre results.</p>

{% include quotes.html content="

Adtomic **burned through my budget** in weeks and I had no idea why it made those changes.

The AI kept recommending keywords I’d already tested — nothing new, **just wasted spend**.

I still have to double-check everything manually because **I don’t trust** the recommendations." %}

<div class="subsection">
<h2 id="discovery"><span class="step-label" aria-hidden="true">DISCOVERY</span>Diving deep</h2>
<p>I wanted to understand how sellers actually think about ads and automation. I dug into:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Competitor analysis (Adtominc, Helium10, JungleScout)</li> 
    <li>Community research (videos, seller groups, Reddit, podcasts)</li>
    <li>Benchmarking & patterns (agentic UX to design for trust)</li> 
    </ul>

<div class="subsection">
  <h2>Key insights </h2>
    <ul class="bold-li">
      <li>Sellers are overwhelmed by complexity </li>
      <p>PPC tools often show an overwhelming amount of data without clear prioritisation.</p>
      <li> Trust in automation is low </li>
      <p>Existing tools act like black boxes; they make changes but rarely explain why.</p>
      <li> Sellers want guidance, not blind automation</li>
      <p>The magic formula is transparency + choice. People want to understand tradeoffs, preview changes and approve actions.</p>
      <li>One metric isn’t enough</li>
      <p>Tools that optimise only for ACoS miss the bigger picture. Sellers want multidimensional insights.</p>

    <p>Designing AI agents is about <strong>building trust</strong>. I used my agentic design principles to make sure recommendations feel transparent, collaborative and not pushy.</p>

<div class="subsection">
        <h3> Onboarding to PPC Campaign </h3>
        <p>Sellers struggle to know where to start with PPC, often fearing wasted spend. I designed the onboarding flow around co-planning and transparency:</p>
        <ul>
        <li> The agent surfaces missed opportunities using the <strong>seller’s data</strong> and sets realistic expectations. </li>
        <li> Each recommendation <strong>explains the “why”</strong> and requires seller approval, keeping automation clear and optional. </li>

        <li> The agent confirms <strong>business goals</strong> upfront and adapts recommendations accordingly, making automation collaborative, not prescriptive. </li>

          <li>The agent acts like a consultant, <strong>showing its work</strong> step by step and explaining why each keyword is recommended or discarded. </li>
          <li>Sellers can <strong>interrupt</strong> anytime to ask follow-up questions, <strong>tweak numbers</strong> or override choices. </li>

        <li>The agent delivers biweekly reports, timed to match when <strong>PPC data stabilises</strong> on the marketplace.</li>

  <h2> System guardrails</h2>
  <p>Automation always creates risk (overspending, biased results, errors). These guardrails protect sellers behind the scenes before any recommendation reaches them:</p>
    <ul class="bold-li">
      <li>Safety Nets</li>
        <p>Budget caps, policy scans, data freshness</p>
      <li>Transparency</li>

  <p>This was a one-week sprint, so I optimised for speed and focused on proving value fast.</p>
  <p>Since then, I’ve deepened my understanding of agentic workflows and would approach future iterations differently: </p>
    <ul class="bold-li">
      <li>Explore inline recommendations</li>
      <p>Test surfacing suggestions directly in the seller’s flow instead of a side panel. </p>
      <li>Refine context-awareness</li>
      <p>Improve continuity across chat history, actions, and recommendations.</p>
    </ul>

</div>


<div class="subsection">
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validate user interactions</strong> → observe how sellers engage with recommendations, approvals, and inline guidance to refine the workflow.</li>
<li><strong>Test tolerance for multi-tasking</strong> → Explore how ready sellers are to trust the agent to execute multiple actions across campaigns simultaneously. </li>
