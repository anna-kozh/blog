<h2>UX Lessons</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Know the rules, break the rules</strong></li>
<p> “Always use labels”, “Never use accordions”, “Never disable buttons” - we sure have a lot of rules in the industry. It’s good to know them, but it’s also important to know when to break them.  </p>

<li><strong>Data > Instincts</strong></li>
<p> Don’t just rely on an “expert opinion” or “instincts” - test your designs and hypothesis, even if it’s with a couple of less-involved coworkers. Beware of the confirmation bias.  </p>

<li><strong>Keep learning, keep upskilling</strong></li>
<p> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQsVmhSa4X-G3lHlUtejzLA" target="_blank">Figma YouTube </a> channel has a gazillion videos. Also, many experts in the field generously share their knowledge for free. I like to follow <a href="https://adamsilver.io" target="_blank">Adam Silver</a> journey through form mastery.  </p>

<li><strong>It’s not about making it easy for yourself</strong></li>
<p> It’s about serving the team and the development process. Your Figma file user is also a Product Manager, a BA, a Developer, and a PR manager - think about them when working on your deliverables. </p>

<li><strong>Designer is not an artist</strong></li>
<p> She is an engineer working in a constrained environment of frameworks, business goals, and time restraints. We’re not here trying to win an Oscar for the best UI; we want our feature to be easy to implement, easy to use, and make revenue for the company. </p>

<h2>Soft skill lessons</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Sometimes you can’t win</strong></li>
<p> And it’s not about how smart or capable or how many “How to Influence People” books you’ve read. You learn and you move on.  </p>

<li><strong>Nobody should fight to be heard</strong></li>
<p> Be that person who gives room to people around the table. Listen. Stay curious.</p>

<li><strong>Relationships, relationships, relationships</strong></li>
<p> Build rapport with your colleagues.</p>

<li><strong>Self-doubt is a part of the journey</strong></li>
<p> Sometimes it’s hard to keep believing in yourself when self-doubt creeps in. Keep your eyes on the prize.</p>

<li><strong>Be supportive of others</strong></li>
<p> Positive reinforcement is essential in the workplace. Compliment the communication manager on her excellent writing style and let her know how much you enjoyed the opening paragraph of her recent article.</p>
