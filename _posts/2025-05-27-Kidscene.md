<h2 id="design"><span class="step-label" aria-hidden="true" >DESIGN</span>Two-sided market</h2>

<p> Most effort went into responsive parent UX, the riskiest and most user-facing part. I mapped the full journey for future scale but handed off only the first iteration. The provider side reused the existing SkoolBag admin console, adjusted for activity listing setup. </p>

<p>I created low-fidelity wireframes to map the full parent flow and align on scope early. I used them in stakeholder reviews to confirm the overall direction, validate filtering and booking logic and reduce risk before committing to UI. </p>

<h2 id="branding"><span class="step-label" aria-hidden="true">BRANDING</span>Branding the Platform from scratch</h2>
<p>I created the full KidScene brand from scratch: logo, colours, components, and visual style. It needed to feel playful for parents and professional for providers. </p>
<p>To move faster, I reused SkoolBag’s setup and Material Design framework. </p>
<p>In hindsight, the colour combo wasn’t ideal for UI. Some colours didn’t meet accessibility standards for text, lacking sufficient contrast.</p>

<div class="m-space"> 
<h2 id="reflections"><span class="step-label" aria-hidden="true">REFLECTIONS</span>What I took from this</h2>
<ul class="bold-li">
<li>Refined my mobile-first skills</li>
<p>Mobile-first design helped me sharpen how I handle scale, hierarchy, and structure across breakpoints. Using rems and ems improved layout consistency and made dev handoff smoother.</p>

<li>Led as both designer and product owner</li>
<p>I led this project across both design and product. I thrived in that level of ownership. I was more deliberate in prioritising based on effort–impact tradeoffs. Collaboration was strong across the board.</p>

<li>Learned proven UX patterns from top platforms</li>
<p>Studying top event platforms helped me unpack how they build trust, design filters and manage listings.
</p>

<li>Upskilled the whole team</li>
<p>Design and dev worked hand-in-hand. I helped the team improve their responsive UI skills, while they helped me sharpen how I communicate design intent.</p>
</ul>

<div class="xs-space">
<h2>Where we left off </h2>
<p>The project was paused just before launch due to a change in business direction. While disappointing, it didn’t take away from the core value we created: a scoped, validated, and strategically designed MVP with buy-in from both sides of the market. </p>

<p>As a lead, I’m proud of how we de-risked the product early, reused what we had, and stayed lean without compromising on quality.</p>

<p class="last-step">This work sharpened how I lead through ambiguity, validate value early, and design for scale from day one. </p>
