description: "'I can't release a product unless it's perfect,' I used to think. But when I had a year to move 1,000 schools and 500,000 parents to a new platform that didn't exist yet, my perfectionism had to take a back seat."

“SkoolBag” (now “Audiri”) is a communication platform, where the two main products are:
<ul>
  <li>School admin console (content creation web app)</li>
  <li>Parent app (content interaction mobile app)</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>I joined SkoolBag when its main goals were to create a new console for school admins and migrate all schools to the new console. Maintenance costs of the current system were getting too high, while performance was too slow. In addition, adding new features was a challenge (e.g. social logins, custom permissions, private messaging, integrations). </p>

<h2>Product strategy</h2>
<p>
In the traditional “waterfall” world, we would have waited until the new platform was polished before migrating all schools into it.
</p>
<p>
But we were not in a waterfall world, we were in a “lean startup” world. That’s why we divided customers into groups based on the features they used and migrated each group once the features were ready. 
</p>

<p>
This approach had multiple advantages:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deliver faster</strong>: Migrate users faster and keep improving based on actual use and customer feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Focus on the customer</strong>: Prioritize features that customers value most.</li>
<li><strong>Save money</strong>: Focus on essential features to reduce waste.</li>
<li> <strong>Spot issues early</strong>: Find and fix problems before they become big.</li>
<li><strong>Lighten CX Load</strong>: Handle fewer customer issues simultaneously.
</li>
</ul>


<h2>
Design strategy
</h2>
<p>
Redesigning the entire system was necessary to achieve several goals, such as making the system responsive to different devices, improving user experience, optimizing performance, and incorporating the new Angular Material framework.</p>
<p>In the design process, I embraced an iterative approach, which really challenged my inner perfectionist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sticking to an MVP-like approach to design quality and feature prioritization</li>
<li>Continuously gathering and integrating user feedback</li>
<li>Keeping clear communication and deliverables despite the frequent changes</li>
<li>Seamlessly integrate with both the old system and the parent app</li>
<li>Maintaining design debt and finding opportunities to address it</li>
<li>Wearing multiple hats to fill in gaps in the process</li>
</ul>

<p>These were some of the wireframes I created while I was at SkoolBag:</p>

<h2>Wearing multiple hats </h2>
<p>In SkoolBag we functioned like a startup with a small team including the CEO, Head of Product, developers, QA, CX team, and myself. This exposed me to all aspects of the business, allowing me an invaluable learning experience during my two years in the role. </p>

<p> In addition to my role, I stepped in as a Product Owner, managing requirement writing and joining feature prioritization discussions. I would kick off work with the dev team through feature reviews and provide ongoing support during feature development.</p>

<p>Ensuring quality, I conducted PR reviews and tested the dev work, often having fun at those late-night debugging sessions with the team. </p>

<p> Collaborating closely with the dev team helped me to design features faster and more efficiently. I also learned about dev tools and processes, occasionally submitting my own PRs with CSS tweaks.</p>

<p>To understand our customers better, I would interact with them on Intercom to resolve issues. </p>
<p> To inform the entire company about our progress, I made <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/2024/06/01/Fresh-off-the-code.html">Product update videos</a>. </p>

<div class="callout thought">I was given the autonomy to own the product, which allowed me to do some cool stuff.

<h2>Mindset shift </h2>
<p>Two years in SkoolBag completely changed my perspective on the development process. With the help of my manager, I adopted a growth mindset. I learned not to be afraid to make mistakes. Understanding that everything I design will evolve and grow over time. I realized that striving for perfection is futile. </p>

<div class="callout idea">A growth mindset is the opposite of perfectionism.</div>

<p>Releasing features that aren’t perfect can be tough. There is a fear of negative feedback, damage to reputation, and customer churn. </p>
<p>While some customers churned, and others complained, the majority were surprisingly supportive. I learned to remind myself that as a designer, I’m wired to seek out imperfections to fix, while my users just want to send that message to parents and move on with their day.  </p>
