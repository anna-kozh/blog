<!-- <p>I'm particularly excited about Remote's design principle of "Insights over intuition". It truly aligns with my values and the kind of designer I aspire to be.</p> -->

<p class="xs-space"><b>I’m known for...</b>
<br>Challenging the status quo when it drives improvement, while delivering results super quickly when execution is key.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>A perfect workday for me looks like...</b>
<br>My team is in the office, we take over a meeting room, dive into a tricky problem, bounce ideas around, laugh a bit, and grab some pizza along the way.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>My ideal work environment...</b>
<br>It encourages collaboration, open communication, trust, and the freedom of independent thinking.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>A challenge I’ve overcome in my career...</b>
<br>Working in difficult environments that tested my confidence. I discovered strategies to rebuild my self-belief and regained my confidence through self-reflection and growth.</p>

<p class="last-step xs-space"><b>When I’m not designing, you’ll find me...</b>
<br>Trying out random creative classes (stand-up, improv, painting), planning a fun event or trip, slowly making my way through the Harry Potter books, or wandering near trees and water.</p>
