<!-- <p>I'm particularly excited about Remote's design principle of "Insights over intuition". It truly aligns with my values and the kind of designer I aspire to be.</p> -->

<p class="xs-space"><b>I’m known for...</b>
<br>Challenging the status quo when it drives measurable improvement, while delivering results quickly when execution speed is critical.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>A perfect workday for me looks like...</b>
<br>My team and I take over a meeting room, unpack a complex problem, sketch and debate solutions and leave with a clear path forward, plus a few good laughs and a shared pizza.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>My ideal work environment...</b>
<br>A high-trust, high-ownership space where individuals lead end-to-end decisions, teams collaborate seamlessly and customer-obsessed solutions are delivered at scale.</p>

<p class="xs-space"><b>A challenge I’ve overcome in my career...</b>
<br>Early on, I worked in environments that tested my confidence. By creating deliberate feedback loops, refining my process and focusing relentlessly on customer outcomes, I rebuilt my confidence and went on to lead projects that became company-wide design standards.</p>

<p class="last-step xs-space"><b>When I’m not designing, you’ll find me...</b>
<br>Trying out random creative classes (stand-up, improv, painting), planning a fun event or trip, slowly making my way through the Harry Potter books, or wandering near trees and water.</p>
